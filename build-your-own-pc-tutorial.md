## 1. Choosing Your PC Parts <a name="choosing-your-pc-parts"></a>

### 1.1 Define Your Purpose

Before selecting components, determine the primary purpose of your PC:
- Gaming
- Content Creation (Video Editing, Graphic Design)
- Productivity (Office tasks, programming)

### 1.2 Set a Budget

Decide on a budget for your PC build. This will guide your component choices and ensure you get the best value for your money.

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The brain of your computer.
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** Essential for gaming and graphic-intensive tasks.
- **Motherboard:** Connects all components and peripherals.
- **Memory (RAM):** Temporary storage for running applications.
- **Storage (SSD/HDD):** Permanent storage for your operating system and files.
- **Power Supply (PSU):** Supplies power to all components.
- **Case:** Houses and protects your components.

### 1.4 Compatibility

Ensure that all selected components are compatible with each other. Check socket types, form factors, and power requirements. Using PCPartPicker will check for compatiblilty.
